##Commenting out this since hugging face needs to dowload and install the model and has to do it with the right permissions, so using a user with limited permissions does not allow to do it
# # Create a non-privileged user that the app will run under.
# # See https://docs.docker.com/go/dockerfile-user-best-practices/

# Download dependencies as a separate step to take advantage of Docker's caching.

##Commenting out this since appuser is not being created anymore for the reason expressed some lines above
# # Switch to the non-privileged user to run the application.
# USER appuser

# Copy the source code into the container.
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the application listens on.
